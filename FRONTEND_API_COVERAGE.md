## API Client vs Frontend Usage

### API Client (api.js)
- **Defines**: All 28 endpoints
- **Status**: 100% complete API wrapper

### Frontend App (app.js)
- **Uses**: 17 endpoints
- **Status**: Core features complete, admin features missing

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Essential Features (Should Add)
1. **Hotel Management UI** for Hotel Managers
   - Create hotel form
   - Edit hotel form
   - View hotel bookings

2. **Admin Dashboard Enhancements**
   - View all bookings
   - Process refunds
   - Manage hotels

### Priority 2: Nice to Have
1. **Review Management**
   - Edit own reviews
   - Delete own reviews

2. **Booking Details**
   - View individual booking details
   - Search bookings by email

### Priority 3: Optional
1. **Payment Details**
   - View payment history
   - Payment receipt view

## Why Some Features Are Missing

### By Design
- **Payment/Refund endpoints**: Admin-only features, not critical for MVP
- **Hotel CRUD**: Manager features, can be added later
- **Review edit/delete**: Nice to have, not essential

### Technical Reasons
- **GET /api/auth/me**: JWT token already contains user info, no need to fetch
- **GET /api/bookings/{id}**: Booking details shown in "My Bookings" list

## Conclusion

The frontend successfully implements:
- ✅ **100% of Guest user features** (primary use case)
- ✅ **Core authentication and authorization**
- ✅ **Complete booking workflow**
- ✅ **Full loyalty program**
- ⚠️ **Partial admin features** (application management only)
- ❌ **No hotel manager features** (create/edit hotels)

**Overall Assessment**: The frontend is **production-ready for guest users** but needs additional work for hotel managers and admins to fully utilize their features.
