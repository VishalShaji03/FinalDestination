# Hotel Manager Application Process Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how legitimate hotel managers can register and get approved to manage hotels on the FinalDestination platform.

## üîê Security Model

For security reasons, all users initially register as **Guests**. Hotel managers must go through an application and approval process to gain hotel management privileges.

### Why This Approach?

- **Prevents Abuse**: Stops malicious users from self-assigning elevated privileges
- **Quality Control**: Ensures only legitimate businesses join the platform
- **Legal Compliance**: Verifies business licenses and documentation
- **Brand Protection**: Maintains platform reputation and trust

## üöÄ Application Process

### Step 1: Register as a Guest

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/register`

```json
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@grandhotel.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "confirmPassword": "SecurePass123!",
  "contactNumber": "+1234567890"
}
```

**Response**: You'll receive a JWT token and be logged in as a Guest.

### Step 2: Submit Hotel Manager Application

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/apply-hotel-manager`  
**Authorization**: Bearer token (from Step 1)

```json
{
  "businessName": "Grand Hotel & Resort",
  "businessAddress": "123 Main Street, Miami, FL 33101",
  "businessLicense": "FL-HOTEL-2024-001234",
  "contactPerson": "John Smith",
  "businessPhone": "+1234567890",
  "businessEmail": "info@grandhotel.com",
  "additionalInfo": "Family-owned hotel operating since 1995. We have 50 rooms and offer luxury accommodations."
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "userId": 123,
  "userName": "John Smith",

  "applicationDate": "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z",
  "status": "Pending",
  "statusText": "Pending"
}
```

### Step 3: Check Application Status

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/auth/my-application`  
**Authorization**: Bearer token

**Response**: Same as Step 2, with updated status and admin notes if processed.

### Step 4: Admin Approval

An administrator will review your application and either:
- **Approve**: Your role is upgraded to Hotel Manager

- **Request More Info**: Additional documentation needed

Once approved, you can immediately start creating and managing hotels!
